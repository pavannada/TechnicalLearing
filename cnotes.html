                    <h2>Quick History of C</h2>
									 Developed by Bell Laboratories in the early seventies
 Borne of two other languages – BCPL and B.

C introduced such things as character types, floating point arithmetic, structures, the
preprocessor, and portability.

The principle objective was to devise a language that was easy enough to
understand to be "high-level" – i.e. understood by humans, but low-level enough
to be applicable to the writing of systems-level software.
 The language should abstract the details of how the computer achieves its
tasks in such a way as to ensure that C could be portable across different
types of computers, thus allowing the Unix operating system to be compiled
on other computers with a minimum of re-writing.

C as a language was in use by 1973, although extra functionality, such as new types, were
introduced up until 1980.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie wrote the seminal work The C Programming
Language, which is now the standard reference book for C.
 A formal ANSI standard for C was produced in 1989.

In 1986, a descendant of C, called C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup,
which is in wide use today. Many modern languages such as C#, Java and Perl are
based on C and C++.

									Guidelines on Structure
When creating your programs, here's a few guidelines for getting a program that can
be easily read and debugged by you (when you come back to it later) and others
(who may have to change your program later).
 A well-structured program should indent (i.e. move to the right by
pressing the tab key once) all instructions inside eac h block (i.e. following
an opening curly brace – {). Therefore, a block inside another block will be
indented twice etc. This helps to show which instructions will be executed,
and also helps to line up opening and closing curly braces.

It is often helpful to separate stages of a program by putting an extra blank
line (and maybe a comment explaining what the next stage does) between
each stage.

Another useful technique that helps the readability inside each instruction is to
put spaces after commas when listing parameters (i.e. data) to be given to a
function. This helps identify where each parameter starts and
3
The Condensed C
makes the program easier to read. Spaces before and after brackets,
assignments (=) and operators (+ - * /  == != etc.) can also help
make things more readable – but this is up to you.
 Start a program with a /* comment */ that explains the purpose of the
program, and who wrote it. This is useful in case you ever have to work on
somebody else's program, and you need to ask them for advice on how it
works.

If you create a new function, put a comment before it showing what data goes in, and
what comes out, and the purpose of the function.
 If you make a change to somebody's program, put a comment at the top
of the program explaining this (e.g. your initials, the date you made the
change, and a one-liner explaining what you did). Then, where you make
the change, put a comment (maybe with your initials and date again)
showing where the change is, and possibly explaining what it is and why it
needed changing. Some people put comments around the old version of
the part of the program that was changed to show what it used to be, in
case it needs to be changed back again some time in the future.
 If a part of your code is quite difficult to follow, or yo u wish to explain why
you have written it the way you have, or even if you wish to say that it
could be improved (and how) but you haven't the time to do it better yet,
then use a comment. Those who read your program later will than you (in
their heads, at least).

The examples given in this guide are generally good examples of how to
structure you
